# Tue Enigma Machine
An Enigma machine is a device that can encrypt and decrypt messages that are written in a fixed sized alphabet
(usually the 26 upper-case Latin letters A-Z). Figure below shows how a battery powered Enigma machine with a four
letter alphabet (ASDF) is wired. The machine is essentially an electric circuit that connects the input switches to
the lights on the output board. In between the input switches and output board there is a complex mechanism that
continually re-routes the circuit, thus scrambling the original message
